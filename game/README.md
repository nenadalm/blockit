JS Browser game made with `Pixi.js`,
`Typescript`, `Bun`, `Vite`.

Bundled to JS using Bun. JS game bundle delivered through Bun HTTP server in sibling workspace.

## Gameplay
Place figures on a grid. Complete rows/cols disapear. Goes on as long as possible, but never forever.

## Points
- 1 Point per placed figure node (max 4 per place).
- 2 Points per removed figure node
- 3 Points per removed figure

The extra rules for points are just for fun. Strictly not necessary, but everyone like watch big number go bigger.
